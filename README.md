# Curriculum Vitae

Repository for my academic curriculum vitae. This is a short and easily readable version for academic purposes. The sources for building the CV is written in LaTeX and was inspired in [birocoles/curriculum](https://github.com/birocoles/curriculum/tree/main), [santisoler/cv](https://github.com/santisoler/cv/tree/main) and [leouieda/cv](https://github.com/leouieda/cv/tree/main).
